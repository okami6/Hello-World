I'm new comer to github.
it's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be italic__

_You**can**combine them_
